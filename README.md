# Hough Transform GPU
GPU Hough Transform Project

# Summary
This is a project I did for my Parallel Programming for Many Core Processors course while doing my Masters Degree.
The purpose of this project was to show how an algorithm could be sped up by using a GPU and the algoirhtm was Plane Detection via a Hough Transform

# Implementation
This project was done in Cuda/C++ and has a bunch of different versions of the algorithm implemented at the same time to compare timings.
It is meant to be run on Google Colab, I have not tested it on any other machine.

# Presentation

If you would like to see my presentation it is in the powerpoint file. 
It has a much more in depth description of the project
